		<b> Welcome, to the Nepal Learning Center </b>
		<br/>
			<p>
				Nepal is a small and beautiful landlocked country sandwiched between the two gigantic countries India and China. Nepal is the birthplace of Gautam Buddha, 
				the founder of Buddhism and is a country of Mount Everest, the tallest peak of the world.
				It is one of the oldest independent and soverign country of the world. The country has a lot of natural resources. Nepal has a potential amount of generating 
				some 83000MW of hydro electric power.
			</p>
			<p>
				Though the country is very rich in terms of natural resources but these resources are not utilised yet. This requires the production of skilled manpower and 
				the development of information technology in the country. The development of information technology has made the world a global village and Nepal can not deny this fact.
				With the promugulation of Nepal's New Constitution - 2015, it has shown some positive signs for the transoformation of country to an industrial era with some economic revolution.
				It is indeed required a greater amount of skilled manpower to achieve this goal. The IT engineers and engineers cannot be separate from it. They have to go hand in hand with other manpowers to 
				achieve this goal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nepal Learning Center aims to provide the skills and necessary techiques to transform the technology enthusiasts to the higher level of expertise. The targeted groups are not only the nepalese 
				people but the people from every nooks and corners of the world. 
				Information technology is developing day by day. Every sector of the society are in the phase of introducing information technology for the rapid development. We can 
				see the use of social medias like facebook, twitter is being helpful to provide the information through out the world.Information technology does not mean only facebook and twitter. 
				It is also useful to sell the vegetables and fruits produced in the remote part of the country to the suburbs or towns. Nepal is an agricultural country. Our agricultural practice is not profit oriented
				rather it is self sustaining. We can yield our crops by using the modern technologies. These technlogies spread to the nook and corner of the country by means of the smart information technolgy.
			</p>
			<p>
				The information technology can be spreaded through out the country if and only if we are able to produce skilled manpowers. The huge amount of IT engineers are required. This is the age of automation. The automation may 
				be industrial automation, home automation or even office automation. The implementation requires the skilled engineers and software developers. The skill is developed if and only if they are updated to the changing world.
				The world is changing every second. The people should be aware of the every changes occuring throughout the world to make him ready and eligible to participate in the competing world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nepal Learning Center is a small effort to assist you to achieve a proportion of your skill and knowledge. We are a path provider but the destination is upto you.
